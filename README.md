[![Build Status](https://aecidjenkins.ait.ac.at/buildStatus/icon?job=AECID%2FAECID%2Fattackmate%2Fmain)]( "https://aecidjenkins.ait.ac.at/job/AECID/job/AECID/job/attackmate/job/main/")

AttackMate is a tool to automate cyber attack scenarios that supports scripting of attack techniques across all phases of the Cyber Kill Chain. AttackMate's design principles aim to integrate with penetration testing and attack emulation frameworks such as Metasploit and Sliver Framework and enables simple execution of commands via shell or ssh. For example, AttackMate enables to execute Metasploit modules or generate payloads and run commands in Metasploit sessions. Moreover, it is able to generate Sliver implants, automatize Sliver to send C2 commands, and configure and compile LD_PRELOAD-rootkits. AttackMate also offers a simple interface to automate shell or ssh interaction, run commands in background mode, transfer files via sftp, and start http clients or servers. All attack steps may be scheduled, chained, and repeatedly executed using a simple configuration file that supports variable declarations and conditional workflows.
