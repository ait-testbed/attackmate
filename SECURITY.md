AttackMate should only be executed against own test or training systems. For this reason, every software bug is treated equally, regardless of whether it is security relevant or not.

*Please note that AttackMate could easily be executed in a dangerous way. For example, by parsing the RESULT_STDOUT of a malicious server. The server response could lead to a command injection. Keep that in mind!
