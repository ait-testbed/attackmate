AttackMate is a command line tool that can perform entire attack chains based on playbooks. It can be used for cybersecurity training as well as for testing detection engines. AttackMate is so designed that any part of an attack can be easily replaced or varied. Furthermore, the playbooks enable the portability and reproducibility of attack chains. A key focus was on user-friendliness and flexibility for attack chain designers.
