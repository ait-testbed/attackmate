How it works
============

AttackMate is designed so that there can be different commands in a playbook which can be executed by corresponding executors. For example, there are executors that can orchestrate Metasploit or executors for the Sliver framework. The attacks that are carried out are real attacks and require vulnerable systems to be successful.
